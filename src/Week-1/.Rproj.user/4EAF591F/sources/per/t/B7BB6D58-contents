## Self-introduction

My name is Wong Zi Xin. I am a Year 3 undergraduate student double majoring in Psychology and Communications and New Media. A fun fact about myself is I really love the cartoon penguin "Pororo", although I have never actually watched it before! 

In my free time, I like to dance. I am a member of the NUS D'Hoppers Dance Crew. I also enjoy travelling, and wish to visit Mongolia one day.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
