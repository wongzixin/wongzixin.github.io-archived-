I was particularly interested in looking at how much the numbers have dwindled since the outbreak of the pandemic, and how much air travel picked up in a post COVID world.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../../../../../../Documents/GitHub/wongzixin.github.io/docs/images/Screenshot 2023-10-23 at 7.22.24 PM.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom this line graph, it is evident that there is a steady increase in the number of air travel passengers since 2011, up till the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019. From 2019-2020, the number of passengers decreased sharply. Following the opening up of borders again from 2020 onwards, there was a gradual increase in the number of passengers again in 2021, and a sharper increase from 2021-2022.\n",
