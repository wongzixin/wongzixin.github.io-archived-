## Welcome to my website! :)

### A brief self introduction...

I am Wong Zi Xin, a Year 3 undergraduate student double majoring in Psychology and Communications and New Media at the National University of Singapore. I am particularly interested in children's moral development, and am currently a part of the NUS Child Development Lab where we look at moral behaviour in children. I aspire to work in a field directly related to children in the future!

### Some fun facts about myself!

To share a little more about myself, I love cafe hopping with my friends and dancing in my free time when I am not caught up with school work and commitments. Some of the cafes on my list to explore include *September Coffee* and *Nesuto*. I also love travelling, and some countries on my bucket list are Nepal, Italy and Vietnam. I recently visited Kyoto and Osaka over the summer break, and miss the delicious food there!

### What's brewing?

I created this website as part of my project for my NM2207 module, and am excited to share my creations with what I have learnt in class! I will soon be starting on my data story project, stay tuned for the end product!
