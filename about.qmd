## Code Folders

Click on any one of the folders below to see what I have been doing and have learnt in each week of class! Each folder contains the data sets I have used, the Code Along practices and Challenge submissions for each week. From Week 9 onward, diary entries logging the progress for my Final Project will be in the folders.
