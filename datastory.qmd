## How have air transportation trends in the region of Europe evolved over the years, especially in a post COVID world?Â 

### To address this question, I conducted a preliminary round of analyses.

First, I was interested in finding out about the yearly number of passengers travelling by air in the European Union region. I was particularly interested in looking at how much the numbers have dwindled since the outbreak of the pandemic, and how much air travel picked up in a post COVID world.

```

From this line graph, it is evident that there is a steady increase in the number of air travel passengers since 2011, up till the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019. From 2019-2020, the number of passengers decreased sharply. Following the opening up of borders again from 2020 onwards, there was a gradual increase in the number of passengers again in 2021, and a sharper increase from 2021-2022.
