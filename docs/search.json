Some of the cafes on my list to explore include September Coffee and Nesuto. I also love travelling, and some countries on my bucket list are Nepal, Italy and Vietnam. I recently visited Kyoto and Osaka over the summer break, and miss the delicious food there!\n\n\n\nI created this website as part of my project for my NM2207 module, and am excited to share my creations with what I have learnt in class! I will soon be starting on my data story project, stay tuned for the end product!"

I was particularly interested in looking at how much the numbers have dwindled since the outbreak of the pandemic, and how much air travel picked up in a post COVID world.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this line graph, it is evident that there is a steady increase in the number of air travel passengers since 2011, up till the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019. From 2019-2020, the number of passengers decreased sharply. Following the opening up of borders again from 2020 onwards, there was a gradual increase in the number of passengers again in 2021, and a sharper increase from 2021-2022."
